IAM
Root Acc : should only be used for creating users and groups
Group : It only contains users  and not groups
Users :  it can be associated with 0 or more groups

Policy are json documents that provide permission and can be assigned to group or user

Role or IAM role: it is created so that services can access resources on our behalf in our accounts .
    These are also a set of permissions



IAM Security tools
1. IAM Credentials Report (account-level): A report that lists all your account's users and the status of their 
various credentials
2. IAM Access Advisor (user-level): Access advisor shows the service permissions granted to a user and when
 those services were last accessed. You can use this information to revise your policies.


 Amazon EC2
• EC2 is one of the most popular of AWS’ offering
• EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service
• It mainly consists in the capability of :
    • Renting virtual machines (EC2)
    • Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
    • Distributing load across machines (ELB)
    • Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)
    • Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understand how the Cloud works

EC2 sizing & configuration options
• Operating System (OS): Linux, Windows or Mac OS
• How much compute power & cores (CPU)
• How much random-access memory (RAM)
• How much storage space:
    • Network-attached (EBS & EFS)
    • hardware (EC2 Instance Store)
• Network card: speed of the card, Public IP address
• Firewall rules: security group
• Bootstrap script (configure at first launch): EC2 User Data


EC2 User Data
• It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 User data script.
• bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts
• That script is only run once at the instance first start
• EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
    • Installing updates
    • Installing software
    • Downloading common files from the internet
    • Anything you can think of
• The EC2 User Data Script runs with the root user


If you start and stop an instance , Public IP may change but private doesn't change


You can use different types of EC2 instances that are optimised for
different use cases (https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)


Introduction to Security Groups
• Security Groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS
• They control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 Instances.

 Security groups only contain allow rules
• Security groups rules can reference by IP or by security group



• Security groups are acting as a “firewall” on EC2 instances
• They regulate:
    • Access to Ports
    • Authorised IP ranges – IPv4 and IPv6
    • Control of inbound network (from other to the instance)
    • Control of outbound network (from the instance to other)



Security Groups
Good to know
• Can be attached to multiple instances
• Locked down to a region / VPC combination
• Does live “outside” the EC2 – if traffic is blocked the EC2 instance won’t see it
• It’s good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access
• If your application is not accessible (time out), then it’s a security group issue
• If your application gives a “connection refused“ error, then it’s an application
error or it’s not launched
• All inbound traffic is blocked by default
• All outbound traffic is authorised by default
